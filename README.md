Shockley–Read–Hall and Auger recombination occurs in solar cells due to different reasons i.e. excess doping, crack, dislocation center, grain boundry etc. In luminescence imaging, the well performing regions glow more than a poorly performing region. Looking from a luminescence image, it is possible to identify the nature of these losses. Also, imaging with different bias and illumination condition provides ways to calculate the spatial distribution of different parameters i.e. series resistance, dark saturation current density, fill factor, open circuit voltage etc.
